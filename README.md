# Final Report
## Abstract:

## Introduction and Data Description:
In this project, we will design an algorithm to most efficiently predict which team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) will be the best. We will also design an algorithm to predict if a player is an all-star for a specific season. To determine what teams are best we will use specific team data that historically correlates to championships. Specifically, we will use data like ORTG (Offensive Rating), where the higher the rating, the better the team's offense, DRTG (Defensive Rating), where the lower the rating, the better the teamâ€™s defense, and TO%, the percentage of possesions that end in turnovers for a team . For determining what player is an all-star, we will use their average points, rebounds, and assists per game, along with the amount of games they played in a season.
